# IBKR Trading Bot (Flask)

This is a Flask-based web dashboard to schedule and execute trading operations using the Interactive Brokers (IBKR) API.

## ‚úÖ What it currently does

- Web dashboard to add new operations (symbol, size, direction, entry/exit time, stop loss, take profit)
- Operations are stored in a local database
- Scheduler runs in background and sends orders to IBKR at the programmed entry time
- Bracket orders are created using stop loss and take profit

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What needs to be fixed

- Orders are **not being reliably sent to IBKR** at the scheduled time
- There might be some misconfiguration or logic error in the scheduler or connection to IBKR
- No need to build new features or strategy logic ‚Äî just ensure the existing system works correctly

## üîß Technologies

- Python 3
